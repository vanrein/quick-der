# Quick (and Easy) DER, a Library for parsing ASN.1

<img alt="Quick DER logo" src="quick-der-logo.png" style="float: right;"/>

> *Quick DER, or if you like, "Quick and Easy DER", is a library for handling
> DER, which is a widely used binary representation of ASN.1 syntax in binary
> formats.  The library describes ASN.1 syntax in a parser table that can be
> fed into library routines, resulting in pointer/length descriptors for the
> individual data fragments.*
