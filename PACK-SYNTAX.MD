A *packing path* is a sequence of instructions for one of the functions
`der_unpack()` or `der_pack()`, which controls how those functions
handle the DER elements in a given DER structure. A packing path may
be considered a program in a very small domain-specific language. A simpler
variation of a similar idea is the
[WALK SYNTAX](WALK-SYNTAX.MD),
which limits itself to finding a single element, but also based on a
(different) walking path expression.

A single packing path can replace dozens of lines of explicit function calls
to manipulate and copy cursors. Standardized packing walks are generated
for the ASN.1 definitions (from RFCs) that Quick DER knows about.

## Declaring and Using a Walking Path

The walk path is described as a sequence of values (steps) that ends
with `DER_PACK_END`. Here, `path_demo` is such a sequence. It is
declared `static const` so that it may be placed in read-only memory,
but that is not required.

    #include <arpa2/quick-der.h>

    static const derwalk path_demo [] = {
            ...,
            DER_PACK_END
    }

which is then used to unpack the DER binary data under a given
`dercursor crs` with

    int prsok;
    dercursor outputs[NUMBER_OF_OUTPUTS_IN_PACK_PATH];
    prsok = der_unpack (&crs, path_demo, outputs, 1);

The `outputs` is an array of `dercursor` that will be filled with
information found in the `path_demo`.  Explicit storage instructions will
put the information there, so the required size of the array is equal to the
fixed number of such instructions in `path_demo`. `der_unpack()` returns
-1 on error, or 0 on success.

## Diving in Head-First

The path described by `path_demo` should be a depth-first traversal of a
*static* structure.  That means that `SEQUENCE OF` and `SET OF`, the two
ways of expressing dynamically sized structures in ASN.1, require special
handling.

To dive in, use a flag `DER_PACK_ENTER` and to leave a nested structure, use
the `DER_PACK_LEAVE` flag.  To store intermediate values, use
`DER_PACK_STORE` as a flag, as in

    static const derwalk path_demo [] = {
            DER_PACK_ENTER | ...,
            DER_PACK_STORE | ...,
            ...,
            DER_PACK_LEAVE,
            DER_PACK_END
    }

Note that `DER_PACK_LEAVE` is an instruction on its own.  The other two
forms are extended with a tag that is verified to match, for instance

    static const derwalk path_demo [] = {
            DER_PACK_ENTER | DER_TAG_SEQUENCE,
            DER_PACK_ENTER | DER_TAG_CONTEXT (0),
            DER_PACK_STORE | DER_TAG_INTEGER,
            DER_PACK_LEAVE,
            DER_PACK_STORE | DER_TAG_OCTETSTRING,
            DER_PACK_LEAVE,
            DER_PACK_END
    }

An example ASN.1 structure that could be traversed by this would be

    demoStruct ::= SEQUENCE {
            demoCounter [0] INTEGER,
            demoName OCTET STRING
    }

After invoking `der_unpack()` on this path, there are two values in the
`output` array of `dercursor`, namely for the two `DER_PACK_STORE`
instructions.  From the following input data,

    30 16                                -- tag SEQUENCE, length 16
       a0 03                             -- tag a0 for [0], length 3
          02 01 07                       -- tag INTEGER, length 1, value 7
       04 09 51 75 69 63 6b 20 44 45 52  -- tag 4, length 9, "Quick DER"

this would make `output[0]` point to the `INTEGER` value 7, with 1 byte
length (i.e. `output[0].derptr` points to the seventh data byte,
with value `0x07`, and `output[0].derlen` is 1), and `output[1]` would point
to  the `OCTETSTRING` contents "Quick DER", with a length of 9 bytes (i.e.
`output[1].derptr` points to the tenth data byte, value `0x51`, and
`output[1].derlen` is 9).

Note how nothing remains of the DER tags or lengths except the length
in the cursor.  This is what you should expect from a Quick and Easy DER
parser -- the calling code should know what tag belongs with `output[0]`
and `output[1]`.

## Dealing with Variable Structures

It is possible to not store everything we encounter.  In the previous situation
we might have used

    static const derwalk path_demo [] = {
            DER_PACK_ENTER | DER_TAG_SEQUENCE,
            DER_PACK_STORE | DER_TAG_CONTEXT (0),
            DER_PACK_STORE | DER_TAG_OCTETSTRING,
            DER_PACK_LEAVE,
            DER_PACK_END
    }

to find `output[0]` set to the DER sequence *contained in* `[0] INTEGER`,
which means the `INTEGER` in DER coding, so in hex
the bytes `02 01 07` instead of just to `07`.  This can be useful at
some times.

Imagine the ASN.1 structure

    aFewPrimes ::= SET OF INTEGER

which is a `SET OF` and can thus contain as many `INTEGER` values as desired.
An example hexdump of a DER value listing the first 5 primes would be

    31 0f        -- SET, containing 15 bytes
       02 01 02  -- INTEGER 2
       02 01 03  -- INTEGER 3
       02 01 05  -- INTEGER 5
       02 01 07  -- INTEGER 7
       02 01 0b  -- INTEGER 11

If we had to store each `INTEGER` in a separate `output[]` entry, we would need
a variable-sized output array.  What `der_unpack()` does in these cases is the
same as demonstrated for `[0] INTEGER` above; it stores the entire structure
*contained inside* the `SET OF` and leaves it for further processing.

The path expression to store this set would be

    static const derwalk path_primes [] = {
            DER_PACK_STORE | DER_TAG_SET_OF,
            DER_PACK_END
    }

The result would be stored in `output[0]` as the sequence `02 01 02 ...`
of length 15. Remember, Quick DER does no copying of data, and this
means thar `output[0].derptr` points inside the original data to the
third byte, and `output[0].derlen` is set to 15. To work with the
stored `SET OF`, you might:

  * use `der_iterate_first()` and `der_iterate_next()` to find the
    individual values in the set;
  * manually skip through the list with `der_skip()` until it hits the end of
    the set;
  * counting the entries with `der_countelements()` and then allocate an array
    `dercursor primal[5]`, in the heap or on the stack, and pass it into
    `der_unpack ()` with the last parameter set to the count of 5.


## Optionals, Choices and the ANYs

Not everything declared in ASN.1 is included in the binary DER format.
Some parts are `OPTIONAL` (and may have a `DEFAULT`, which Quick DER does not
capture) and others are a `CHOICE` from variants.

To encode an option, prefix `DER_PACK_OPTIONAL,` to the optional part.  If the
optional part is flagged wth `DER_PACK_ENTER`, then the optionality will
continue to the corresponding `DER_PACK_LEAVE`.  Note that ASN.1 ensures that
the DER format can always be parsed based on a singly tag lookahead, which we
exploit in this case.

A somewhat similar structure is the `CHOICE` which permits choosing a syntax
variety from among alternatives.  Again, ASN.1 ensures that parsing can be done
based on the first tag.  We use this once more, for paths between
`DER_PACK_CHOICE_BEGIN` and `DER_PACK_CHOICE_END`.  Note that the programmer
of the walking path is responsible for proper nesting, also with respect to
`ENTER`/`LEAVE` structure.

Finally, the forms `ANY` and `ANY DEFINED BY` are used in ASN.1 to describe
wildcard typing.  These have no representation in DER either, but at the
point where it comes across the `DER_PACK_ANY` instruction,
it will match anything, and store the result in the output array of
`dercursor`.  The stored result is special however, in that it includes the
entire DER structure including tag and length bytes.  This is because you
will have to do further processing.


## Overlay structures

The idea of static structure is a great benefit to us as programmers, because
we can create overlay structures that consist solely of `dercursor` and other
overlay structures.  These give us a way to navigate through the data using
ASN.1 labels.

The first ASN.1 structure

    demoStruct ::= SEQUENCE {
            demoCounter [0] INTEGER,
            demoName OCTET STRING
    }

could be overlaid with the C structure

    typedef struct {
            dercursor demoCounter;
            dercursor demoName;
    } ovly_demoStruct;

and the program could declare

    ovly_demoStruct output;

and pass that to `der_unpack()` as `(dercursor *) &output` for type correctness.

The datafields could then be addressed with something like

    printf ("Found \"%.*s\"\n", output.demoName.derlen, output.demoName.derptr);


## Repacking

There is a function `der_pack()` that does the exact opposite of `der_unpack()`,
using the same walking paths.

*Something to ignore until you run into trouble:*
You may need to `der_prepack()` first if you have nested elements that are not
a `SET (OF)` or `SEQUENCE (OF)` or other form that is always Constructed.
Without `der_prepack()` your DER representation may end up being Primitive.


## ASN.1 Compiler and RFC Library

The can generate this syntax automatically from common ASN.1 files, including
the overlay structures.  The result of this is a headerfile providing macros
that can fill paths, and structures that capture the structure of ASN.1 and
specifically the labels used.

Now we have a compiler, we have started to collect RFCs (and we may later add
other specifications) that use ASN.1 syntax, and to derive their header files
for distribution in the developer version of Quick and Easy DER.

These things combined enable you to specify things like

    #include <arpa2/quick-der.h>
    #include <quick-der/rfc5280.h>

    typedef DER_OVLY_rfc5280_Certificate Certificate;
    derwalk path_cert [] = { DER_PACK_rfc5280_Certificate, DER_PACK_END };

    void print (dercursor *input) {
            Certificate crt;
            if (der_unpack (&input, path_cert, (dercursor *) &crt, 1) == 0) {
                    ...crt.tbsCertificate.issuer...
            }
    }

In short, you are already up and running with DER-encoded PKIX Certificates.

And it will be

Quick... and Easy!
