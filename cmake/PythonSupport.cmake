# PythonSupport.cmake -- support-macros for using Python cross-platform
#
# This module provides one function for manipulating PYTHONPATH and one
# macro for finding a Python3 interpreter; it uses whatever is most
# suitable for the current CMake version to find it, but provides an
# old-fashioned interface.
