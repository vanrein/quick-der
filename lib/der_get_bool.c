 * Do accept all BER encodings of BOOLEAN, meaning, any non-zero byte is
 * interpreted as TRUE, even though DER is more explicit with 0xff.
 *
 * Upon encountering an error, return -1; success decoding as BER is 0.
 * Even when an error is reported, the value is updated, so it is safe
 * to ignore the error in order to facilitate a more lenient parser
 * even than BER.  Even when excessive in size, the value is set to
 * FALSE only when all bytes (possibly zero bytes) are 0x00.
