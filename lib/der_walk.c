/* Update a cursor expression by walking into a DER-encoded ASN.1 structure.
 * The return value is -1 on error, and errno will be set accordinly, and the
 * cursor will not have been updated.  Otherwise, the return value is the number
 * of unprocessed bytes on the path, so 0 when the entire path was processed.
 * The count as non-error returns, so the cursor is updated.  Values higher than
 * 0 indicate where in the path a tag could not be found; this may be helpful in
 * learning about the structure that was being parsed, for example that an
 * OPTIONAL or CHOICE part was absent from the DER bytes.
 *
 * Paths are sequence of one-byte choices to be made.  These choices are tags,
 * because these are used by ASN.1 to decide on parsing choices to be made.
 * The one difference is the interpretation of the Primitive/Constructed bit: when
 * this is set to Primitive, the value will be skipped (even if it is Constructed)
 * and when set to Constructed, the value will be entered and interpreted as ASN.1
 * (even when it is setup as Primitive).
 *
 * In all the places where ASN.1 defines choices, such as CHOICE or OPTIONAL,
 * it enforces distinct tags from the various choices.  This can be used in a path
 * to skip such unknown parts in the encoding.
 *
 * When entering a BIT STRING, special treatment is implemented; the remaining
 * bits will have to be zero, and these are then skipped while entering the
 * remainder.  Note that this ensures that the byte-aligned DER structures are
 * properly packed into a bit-aligned BIT STRING container.
