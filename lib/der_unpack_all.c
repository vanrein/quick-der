/* Unpack a structure, including any substructures that take the repetitive
 * forms SEQUENCE OF and SET OF.  These structures are not analysed by
 * standard der_unpack() because they lead to arrays, not structures, so
 * an overlay is difficult to make.  We use the union dernode, that is
 * initially filled with the .wire format with a standard .derptr and .derlen
 * combination covering the entire contents of the SEQUENCE/SET OF.  Then we
 * continue by figuring out how much memory is needed to unpack it for the
 * number of elements in the concrete data, we allocate it and unpack the
 * array, delivering the elements in the the .info variant of the union.
 * The .wire format is rendered unusable by that operation.
 *
 * The function is applied recursively, so anything in the repeating structure
 * that repeats will be treated in the same manner.  Note that although this
 * practice is unrestricted when looking at the grammar, it will always be
 * bounded in time due to the actual data that is bounded -- normal practice
 * for a parser with a cyclic grammar.
 *
 * This routine may be used, or you may instead prefer to use your own
 * routines to reach the same result.  It is up to you!  Note that the
 * routine starts with a plain der_unpack(), so you do not have to call
 * that initially.  The outarray will be used for that, but unlike what
 * der_unpack() does, it will point to arrays from any SEQUENCE/SET OF,
 * with .derray pointing to the first structure, and .dercnt holding the
 * number of such structures.  You are expected to know the structure to
 * expect, and cast the .derray pointer to that (der_structure *) and not
 * index more than .dercnt-1 elements of der_structure.
 *
 * The mpalloc() callback is used to allocate memory; the first argument
 * is set to the mpool parameter, and may represent a memory pool or any
 * other state/context that is of interest to mpalloc().  It is assumed
 * tht the state/context is used to cause all allocations to be freed at
 * once, even when der_unpack_all() fails it will not care for this!
 *
 * This routine returns 0 on success, or -1 on failure; in the latter
 * case, errno has been set to an indication of the detected problem.
