/* WRITING GOOD DER TARVERSAL PATHS.
 *
 * A path constitutes a “lazy” parser going through a DER structure.  It will
 * trigger faults when it runs into them, but will otherwise be quite permissive.
 * The lazy thing is that it simply advances a cursor to move through the ASN.1
 * specification.
 *
 * To write an ASN.1 path expression, know the place where your cursor starts,
 * which usually is the entire structure you stored in a buffer, and know where
 * it should end.  To get to the end point, you will need to do a series of
 * actions, namely skipping entries and entering other entries.  A path is
 * basically a series of such steps.
 *
 * The ASN.1 syntax assures parseability with only one tag of lookahead.  This
 * means that at any choice point in the syntax, you can safely skip ahead to the
 * one you meant to find.  So, ignore a CHOICE and skip any OPTIONAL bits
 * unless they are actually part of your path.
 *
 * The path traversal mechanism is a lazy syntax check, meaning it will check
 * precisely those parts that it needs to traverse the path, but accept anything
 * else without giving it a second look.  In other words, the code is sufficiently
 * secure to not accept badly formatted data, but only inasfar as you actually
 * need that data.  To this end, an OPTIONAL tag may be skipped by prefixing
 * it with a special tag, and a CHOICE may be skipped regardless of the actual
 * choice it made (if you want to enter either form, you should simply indicate
 * the desired tag and the parser may return that it stopped being able to parse
 * the structure from that point in your code, which tells you to try another path
 * from the cursor position).  And yes, you can have an optional choice by
 * first using DER_WALK_OPTIONAL, DER_WALK_CHOICE, DER_TAG_…
 *
 * Path components are specified by their tags, for which definitions follow; in
 * addition, a flag DER_WALK_SKIP or DER_WALK_ENTER
 * should be added to signal skip or enter.  Note that the
 * first component is not being matched; you should compare its tag by
 * looking what the cursor points at.  You should first ensure that you did not
 * end up in an empty data structure though.  Paths are stored in derwalk[]
 * that end in DER_WALK_END.
 *
 * There is no support for the long-form tag; that is, tags 31 with continued
 * tag bytes; it is assumed that a tag always fits in one byte and otherwise
 * ENOTIMPL is reported.
 *
 * An example path, with made-up ASN.1 markup in comments, is:
 *
 *	derwalk [] = {
 *		DER_WALK_ENTER | DER_TAG_SEQUENCE,      // SEQUENCE OF
 *		DER_WALK_ENTER | DER_TAG_CONTEXT (0),   // [0]
 *		DER_WALK_OPTIONAL,
 *		DER_WALK_SKIP  | DER_TAG_BOOLEAN,       // amActive BOOLEAN OPTIONAL
 *		DER_WALK_CHOICE   ,                     // myMood CHOICE { …. }
 *		DER_WALK_SKIP  | DER_TAG_OCTET_STRING,  // myNAME OCTET STRING
 *		DER_WALK_ENTER | DER_TAG_SEQUENCE,      // options SEQUENCE OF
 *		DER_WALK_END
 *	};
 *
 * Having found the sequence we’re interested in, we could iterate over its
 * elements.
 *
 * There certainly is room for a developer’s tool that creates such paths from a
 * textual description and the ASN.1 syntax description.  Perhaps the formats
 * used by libtasn1 could help doing this.  Compared to libtasn1, the advantage
 * of this approach is that the code is simpler, memory management is simplified
 * by using shared data, and that ought to improve efficiency rather dramatically.

/* PARSING AN ENTIRE STRUCTURE
 *
 * Although it is useful to be able to construct paths that walk through
 * DER-encoded ASN.1 data, it is often more useful to parse a structure
 * and put its values into a general data structure.  This can be done
 * by describing the entire syntax, in much the same fashion as a walking
 * path that meanders through the entire structure.  Ideally of course,
 * this is automatically derived from an ASN.1 syntax description.
 *
 * The idea of parsing an entire structure is like a depth-first walk
 * through the entire structure, and store all the individual components
 * into a cursor of their own.  The combined cursors can be overlayed
 * by a structure type that has field names to match the ASN.1 syntax,
 * so as to simplify locating entries to use in a program.
 *
 * Where we used symbols starting with DER_WALK_ to describe walking paths,
 * we will use symbols starting with DER_PACK_ to describe the syntax
 * descriptions, and we will use them both for packing and unpacking
 * DER syntax.
 *
 * The flags DER_PACK_ENTER and DER_PACK_STORE indicate what to do with
 * the current item being walked past; _ENTER unfolds a structures and
 * dives into it, with the intention of backing out later using a
 * DER_PACK_LEAVE.  It is normal for the first instruction to have a
 * DER_PACK_ENTER flag.  The alternative flag is DER_PACK_STORE, which
 * indicates that the present tag should not be processed, but instead
 * be stored as a dercursor in the provided output array.
 *
 * Entries immediately following DER_PACK_OPTIONAL (including those
 * structures marked in ASN.1 with a DEFAULT value, which by the way is
 * not installed while unpacking a DER structure) will be skipped when
 * they do not match; in case of DER_PACK_STORE flags, the respective
 * dercursor structures will be set to derptr NULL and derlen 0.
 *
 * The ASN.1 pattern of a CHOICE between alternative substructures is
 * marked between DER_PACK_CHOICE_BEGIN and DER_PACK_CHOICE_END, and may
 * be surrounded by DER_PACK_OPTIONAL_ markers.  Each of the possible
 * substructures is tried on the upcoming DER element, and all that do
 * not match fill a dercursor structure with derptr NULL and derlen 0.
 * As soon as one has matched, it is handled as specified and the
 * remaining choice options are all set to derptr NULL and derlen 0.
 * When encountering DER_PACK_CHOICE_END, it is tested whether one of
 * the choices was fulfilled, except when DER_PACK_OPTIONAL_ markers
 * surround the choice section.
 *
 * Not all elements have a predictable number of dercursors, in which
 * case they must be parses them in a special manner.  This is true
 * for the SEQUENCE OF and SET OF constructs; their total content needs
 * to be _STOREd in a first pass, and separately parsed into an array
 * of dercursors (or an overlayed structure type).  The caller allocates
 * the space where it wants --on the stack or form a heap-- and also
 * has the option of running through the contents with iterators based
 * in the cursor that was _STOREd.
 *
 * Having done all this, we now have a structure that holds the various
 * pieces of our DER structure, with field names that derive from the
 * ASN.1 syntax.  In fact, using the same structural descriptions that
 * also derive from the ASN syntax, we should be able to reproduce the
 * DER information from the parser output structures.
 * (NOTE: Variations in Primitive-or-Constructed?

/* COMPOSING DER STRUCTURES FOR TRANSMISSION
 *
 * While working with DER data, the various dercursor structures can be passed
 * around freely, because they are mere <pointer,length> tuples that reference
 * independently management memory -- usually an input buffer.  As long as the
 * input buffer is not cleared, the tuples can be carried around and copied
 * and destroyed at will.
 *
 * Just like overlay structures are filled with dercursor fields labelled
 * according to the ASN.1 syntax during der_unpack(), it is also possible to
 * build up such structures for output with der_pack().  These structures
 * must once more refer to independently allocated memory, which may be any
 * mixture of sources: input buffers, stack portions, heap structures.  As
 * long as these memory regions are kept around during der_pack().  After
 * der_pack(), a new output area has been filled and the fragments can be
 * cleared, deallocated and so on.
 *
 * The der_pack() routine is based on the same DER_PACK_ syntax descriptions
 * used by der_unpack(), so it is straightforward to unpack a structure, make
 * some modifications and pack its new incarnation.
 *
 * One point of concern is the DER_STORE_ structure.  This can both be used
 * for Primitive types and for Constructed types such as SEQUENCE OF and
 * SET OF that either need an additional call to der_unpack() to be parsed,
 * or iteration, or der_walk().  Reproducing those pieces literally is not
 * a problem, and leads to the original data as a Primitive type.  But when
 * the data is in fact Constructed, or perhaps modified, something else is
 * required.  To accommodate that, you may need to der_prepack() such partial
 * structures that are to be dealt with a Constructed types; most commonly
 * however, is that this is necessary for SEQUENCE OF and SET OF, which never
 * occur as Primitive types, and are therefore always treated correctly.
 *
 * The general idea of der_prepack() is that you supply a dercursor array
 * and set it up in the original structure stored by DER_STORE_.  This
 * leads to a different representation that will be recognised by
 * der_pack() as a reference to such an array, which it will insert as
 * a Constructed subtype, with the tag that it originally had during
 * parsing.  Specifically, the highest bit of derlen, identified by the
 * symbol DER_DERLEN_FLAG_CONSTRUCTED, will be set to indicate that the
 * remainder of the derlen is to be interpreted as a number of dercursors,
 * to be found at the derptr.  This differs from the usual meaning, which
 * is a literal series of bytes pointed to by derptr and whose length is
 * stored in derlen.  TODO: Do we really want to do it this way?!?
 *
 * Note that the special ASN.1 constructs "ANY" and "ANY DEFINED BY" are
 * not a problem.  They are stored with the tag and length included, and
 * are therefore trivial to reproduce.  Also, the CHOICE and OPTIONAL
 * versions are trivially handled by having NULL dercursors.  Do avoid
 * calling der_pack() with multiple options in one CHOICE set though.
 *
 * Based on all this, the der_pack() routine can scan over the syntax,
 * look at the data at hand and determine what needs to go where.  It
 * is often good to know the storage space before writing, and
 * der_packlen() can be used to determine that.
 *
 * Since der_pack() assumes it is provided with the properly sized
 * memory buffer to write to, it will start at the end and work its
 * way back.  This means that lengths are known at their time of
 * insertion into the buffer.  The idea stems from MIT Kerberos5,
 * but unlike that implementation we do use a "forward" description
 * and merely traverse it from the end to the beginning.  Note that
 * the DER_PACK_ descriptions lend themselves well for doing this.
